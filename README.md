# Smart-Fan

<h3>Temperature controlled Fan using Arduino</h3>

<p><i>In this project, we are going to build a temperature-controlled fan using Arduino. With this circuit, we will be able to adjust the fan speed in our home or office according to the room temperature and also show the temperature and fan speed changes on a 16x2 LCD display. To do this we will be using an Arduino UNO Board, resistors, capacitor, connecting wires LCD,LM35 temp sensor, diode , mosfet  ,potentiometer and DC fan that is controlled by using PWM. 
PWM is a technique by which we can control the voltage or power. For example ,if you are applying 5 volt for driving a motor then motor will moving with some speed, now if we reduces applied voltage by 2 means we apply 3 volts to motor then motor speed also decreases. This concept is used in the project to control the voltage using PWM.</i></p>
